  None of us were expecting our lives to be disrupted due to Covid-19 pandemic this year.
  Many of us are in a lockdown situation again, unable to continue what we have been doing, unable to travel and see
  loved ones.

  This mood board was made to record how we're coping during this time around the globe.

  You may leave your worries, hopes, and dreams. And perhaps while browsing others', you'll see you're not
  alone, that we're in this together.
