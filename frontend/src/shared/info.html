    None of us were expecting our lives to be disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year.
    Many of us are in a lockdown situation again, unable to continue what we have been doing, and unable to travel and
    see
    loved ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mood board was made to record how we are coping during this time around the globe.
    You may leave your good and bad moods — your worries, hopes, and dreams. And perhaps while browsing others’, you
    will see that we are in this together.
